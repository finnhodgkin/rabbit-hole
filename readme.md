# API rabbit hole.

### Wikipedia rabbit hole

Just clone the repo or visit the live version [here](https://finnhodgkin.github.io/rabbit-hole/wikipedia-rabbit-hole/index.html)

### Wordnik dictionary rabbit hole

The dictionary rabbit hole was created with the Wordnik API.

Unfortunately Wordnik uses private API keys so in order to get your own version working you'll need an API key from [here](http://developer.wordnik.com/). Once you're signed up just add a 'config.js' file with the following line to the project root:

`var _WORDNIK_API_KEY = '<YOUR KEY HERE>';`

Enjoy.
